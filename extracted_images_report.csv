As shown in Figure  3c , after 2.5 h, a higher current is observed in the E-Baseline cell suggesting that side reactions occurred continuously when cy- cling at high voltage, but these side reactions were eﬀectively suppressed for the DB203 and DB153 cells. The higher leakage current observed in the ﬁrst two to three hours for BTFEE-based LHCEs cells can be attributed to irreversible reactions during the EEI (including SEI and CEI layers) formation process on anode and cathode. This suggests that the BTFEE-based LHCEs have a distinct pathway for EEI formation compared to the E-Baseline. In addition, the leakage current of DB203 is slightly higher than that of DB153. This observation may be ascribed to the elevated DME amount in DB203, which induces more oxidation of free- DME molecules at voltages more than 4.0 V. [ 21,39 ]   The ﬁrst charge- discharge curves of Li||NMC811 cells are presented in Figure  3d . The E-Baseline, DB203, and DB153 cells exhibit small variations in CEs, with values of 84.5%, 84.8%, and 85.7%, respectively. These diﬀerences suggest that there is no evidence of structural changes but rather indicate the presence of degree of irreversible reactions in diﬀerent electrolytes. This observation agrees well with the results of the leakage current measurement. The long-term cycling stability of Li||NMC811 full cells with diﬀerent electrolytes was examined in the coin-cells using Li metal (50  μ m) anode and NMC811 cathode (96% active mate- rial,  ≈ 4.0 mAh cm − 2 ). The cells were charged and discharged at a rate of 0.1C for 2 cycles, where 1C  =  4.0 mA cm − 2 . Subsequently, they were charged and discharged at rates of 0.1C and 0.33C, re- spectively, while cycling within the potential range of 2.8–4.4 V as shown in Figure  3e . Among the cells with three diﬀerent elec- trolytes, the DB153 cell demonstrated the best capacity retention of 80% after 470 cycles while the DB203 cell exhibited 80% ca- pacity retention in 419 cycles. In contrast, the E-Baseline cell ex- hibited a cycling capability of up to 290 cycles with 80% areal ca- pacity retention when tested under the similar conditions. Com- paring with other electrolyte reported in the literature (see Table S2 , Supporting Information), Li||NMC811 cells with DB153 elec- trolyte and high-loading cathode (4.0 mAh cm − 2 ) have demon- strated outstanding cycling stability when charged to 4.4 V",viscosities; conductivity; capacity retention; cycling performance; conductivities; coulombic efficiency; coulombic efficiencies; electrolyte; viscosity; lithium metal,0.822; 0.821; 0.748; 0.706; 0.661; 0.642; 0.642; 0.596; 0.575; 0.460

By benchmarking a classic reference, [20]   LSV was also conducted in a Li j LiMn 2 O 4  (LMO) cell configuration to study the electrochemical stability windows of the electro- lytes in practical batteries (Figure S6), where the 1 M LiFSI- cFTOF electrolyte exhibited an oxidation stability up to 4.5 V. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level was also utilized to assess the oxidation vulnerability at positive potentials to avoid overestimated electrolyte stability. [21]   In agreement with the LSV result, cFTOF exhibited a lower HOMO energy level (    7.95 eV) compared to that of TOF (    7.5 eV) (Figure S7) due to the introduction of an electron-withdrawing     CF 3  group [22]   to a ring-chain molecular structure. In order to study the solvation structure of the electro- lytes, Raman spectroscopy analysis was conducted for the two electrolytes. In 1 M LiFSI-TOF electrolyte, the majority of FSI     exists as a free anion (730 cm    1 ) and as a contact-ion pair (CIP, an FSI anion coordinating to one Li + ) (743 cm    1 ) due to the strong Li +   coordinating ability of TOF solvent. In the case of 1 M LiFSI-cFTOF electrolyte, however, there were no free FSI anions present and almost all FSI anions remain in an aggregate (AGG, a FSI     anion coordinating to two or more Li + ) (753 cm    1 ) state, suggesting the majority of cFTOF exists in a free state and more FSI     anions move to the anode along with Li +   to induce anion-derived SEI composition (Figure 1f). [23]   We also tested the effect of higher salt concentration, that is 2 M LiFSI (2 M LiFSI- cFTOF), and the Raman band corresponding to AGG was remarkably enhanced through the intensive association between Li +   and FSI anions (Figure S8). The unusual solvation structure with predominantly AGG state even at low-salt-concentration is ascribed to the fluorinated ring- chain molecular design of the solvent. These findings were also further verified by Fourier transform infrared spectro- scopy (FTIR) analysis, where a solvated peak of the TOF solvent coordinating to Li +   appeared in the 1 M LiFSI-TOF electrolyte, whereas it was significantly suppressed in the 1 M LiFSI-cFTOF electrolyte (Figures 1g and S9) due to the weakened solvation power of cFTOF.

Al corrosion by electrolytes was also investigated (Fig- ure S22). Compared with the severe corrosion and crack formation on Al foil in the case of 1 M LiFSI-TOF electro- lyte, cFTOF-based electrolytes exhibited excellent Al anti- corrosion properties at 5 V for 48 hours. The cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) was characterized by XPS analysis to evaluate the compatibility between the electro- lyte and high voltage cathode (Figures S23–S26). The formation of a LiF-rich CEI layer was observed in the cFTOF-based electrolytes, and this modified CEI layer plays a pivotal role in extending the cycle life. Cathode morphol- ogy changes in Li j NCM811 full cells with different electro- lytes after 20 cycles at 0.5 C were also compared (Fig- ure S27), where we observed no obvious difference between electrolytes. CEI of cathode with different electrolytes was also analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) after 100 cycles (Figure S28). cFTOF-based electrolytes exhibited a thinner and more uniform CEI layer compared to 1 M LiFSI-TOF electrolyte. The systematic analysis of cFTOF-based electrolytes revealed that cFTOF can, on the anode side, promote anion decomposition to form LiF-rich SEI layer through strong Li + -FSI binding leading to stable Li plating, while facilitating the formation of stable, LiF-rich and thin CEI layer on the cathode surface to realize stable cycling.",conductivity; viscosities; cycling performance; capacity retention; electrolyte; coulombic efficiency; coulombic efficiencies; conductivities; viscosity; lithium metal; anode; cathode,0.805; 0.791; 0.704; 0.702; 0.663; 0.624; 0.624; 0.623; 0.569; 0.516; 0.442; 0.442
